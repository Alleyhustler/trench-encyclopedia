      <p><i>You find a mysterious door with a wheel instead of a doorknob. Through experientation, you find turning the wheel different increments causes the door to open
      to <b>different locations</b>- cozy storefronts, summoning chambers, a valley in a desert.</i>
      <br><br>I spent a lot of time from 2019-2021 on various petsites, running art stores and events. This is my attempt to find and catalogue all of them to keep track of times in my life that were special, art I'm proud of, and games that allowed me to connect and interact with a community I card about. 
      <br><br>I'm not sure how I feel about the stability of these forums- I don't expect them to die suddenly, but I also didn't expect many other communities I cared about in my childhood about to suddenly shut down either. So, a link is included to an archive.org screenshot of the first page *just in case*, and then at least one thing would be saved.

          <h2><a href="https://goblincat.itch.io/hanas-light">Hana's Light</a> / 2025</h2>
          <p>A hidden object/narrative game about finding the remnants of your dead friend, and also catboys. I fulfilled my promise in the the previous entry of this page and learned Godot! This game was made as a team: I did programming and some of the BG art.</p>
          <p>Made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/the-worst-game-jam-2025">TWG Game Jam</a></p>
          <p>The art for the game (and the cover you see on this page) was created by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/63choux.bsky.social">Emily!</a></p>

          <p>A game about trying to get through a first date without turning into a werewolf! Made in a team of three for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/pirate">Pirate Jam 15</a>, with me exclusively on art. It was extremely fun to work in a team and we made a game I am SUPER proud of. Now I'm very motivated to learn Godot... </p>

          <p>An idle game about running a cat cafe. One of the many projects I made in the month between graduation and the start of my first job (which was also at the beginning of the pandemic, rip). An ode to a pet adoption game I used to play on girlsgogames, which I never found again after the 2010s but had the same "get an animal, name it, find it a home" mechanic. </p>

          <h2><a href="https://goblincat.itch.io/butterfly-breeder">Butterfly Breeder</a>/ 2020</h2>
          <p>A relaxing game about combining butterflies. Stripped down my favorite Flight Rising mechanic and indulged my love of gatcha - all I want to do is put two things together and see what the random result is! 
          <br>Another game made post-graduation, pre-job.</p>

          <p>RPG-style game about raising a kid and balancing the need to keep give them the life experience to live on their own vs the need to keep them safe. Made for a class final in a haze right after the beginning of the COVID lockdown.

          <h2><a href="https://goblincat.itch.io/what-animal-are-you">What Animal Are You?</a> / 2020</h2>
          <p>A personality test in Picrew format, made for a school project to design a game within a game. I never get tired of filling out personality quizzes and picrews and comparing results with friends. Both touch the same joy and one of the main appeal of games for me: self-expression.

If you're trying to be clever in finding secret items- good job! I didn't put one here actually, but here are some hints:
- There are currently 5 items
- One is a skull, and it's where you'd expect it to be
- One is an animal, and hidden among others
- There is a book, but it's not the item on the bookshelf

Thanks to https://ascii.co.uk/art/skulls for the skull

        "The fact that dragons have hoards is well-known, however the relationship is deeper than we used to believe. These items are so important that what a dragon chooses to collect at a young age has effects on its physical development. This was surprising to many researchers, as the dragons they believed were distinct breeds were actually closely related, but had different tastes in treasure."

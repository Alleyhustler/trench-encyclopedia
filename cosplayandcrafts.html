      <br>I started cosplaying in high school, stopped in college due to time and money constraints, and restarted in 2022 after being inspired by a friend. The below photos are all my most recent cosplays, con outfits, and other clothing and jewelry crafting projects.

      <p>I used to be obsessed with Love Nikki in college, and since it's a dressup game, it feels fitting to make a cosplay of one of their suits! This one is of <a href="https://lovenikki.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_Huntress">Demon Huntress</a>. The suit is one my favorites aesthetically, but more importantly, is also really useful in-game because of the leg and arm pose haha. </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.serebii.net/music/projectvoltage/">Project Voltage</a> is such a cool idea, and I'm so glad I got to cosplay designs from it with xingkari! My favorite AND least favorite part was the wig- I'm super proud of the solution I came up with to keep her buns, pigtails, and bandanna easy to wear (they are all attached to a single headband that I can put on/take off easily throughout the day), but it was SO heavy. Kudos to all Miku and Sailor Moon cosplayers out there who deal with giant twintails...</p>
      <p>Trapinch was sadly lost during Anime Boston.... I saw other cosplayers carrying around a Trapinch plushie right before we left, so I can only hope they found him and he's leading a happy life with another nerd...byebye buddy...</p>

      <p>Qifrey from Witch Hat Atelier! He was super fun to make and cosplay as a group with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xingkari.jpeg/">@xingkari.jpeg</a>. He was also the first cosplay I got profressional photos in, which was a super cool experience and definitely something I'd like to do again. </p>

      <p>Marcille from Dungeon Meshi is one of my favorite characters of all time, and I started this cosplay right when her dungeon lord chapter came out! Despite it looking simple, this cosplay was super challenging to make- learning how to sew faux fur, my sewing machine not being able to sew through the dress so hand-sewed most of it, and figuring out how to make my face look good with blonde hair. The hardest thing was the staff- it was originally made with PVC pipes and foam for the top but that kept breaking off during the con, so now the top has a 3d printed base that is a little sturdier. I am super happy with how the rope came out to mimic her woven staff though!  </p>

      <p>This cosplay is of an original character I just call "Maskface" in my head. I got super interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animegao_kigurumi">animegao kigurumi</a> in 2022 along with dolls. It was somehow super affirming to me to wear a monstergirl face, and I try to take her out to most cons to get a chance to walk around as her. I like the doll/bjd-face look more than the anime masks that are easier to find (on the English web at least), so I'd love to make my own one day! </p>
      <p><b>Credits:</b> The mask was purchased from <a href="https://gurglelovemask.taobao.com/">Gurgle Love on Taobao</a>.
